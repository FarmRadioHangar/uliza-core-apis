# API server example

This is an example of how to implement and secure a simple Node.js API server using Auth0 and OAuth 2.0. (In this terminology, the API is known as the Resource Server.) 

This server application can be used together with the [node-api-access client example](auth0/clients/node-api-access) to demonstrate the [Authorization Code Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) flow. 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. Then install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
npm start
```
